# Code Using A Style Guide

You recently joined an app development team contracted to build an app for a ski resort. They have a style guide with annotations. The project has already been started so some of the features exist and there are some that we'll need to add.

In the Xcode project there are warnings for each task to accomplish. You will need to build the project (cmd + B) to see the warnings.
